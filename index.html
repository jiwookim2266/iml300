        <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>

        <p>
          This project is driven by my passion for raising awareness about Korea’s declining birthrate and aging population. 
          I wanted to experiment with data visualization while incorporating audio to make the experience more engaging.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first graph uses bar heights and baby-crying sounds to represent birth numbers, the second shows bouncing population circles whose sound 
          volume changes with size, and the third visualizes the super-aged population with branching veins. Users can return home by pressing ESC.
        </p>

        <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
        <a href="Kodokushi/index.html">Kodokushi</a>

        <p>
          This project explores the quiet loneliness behind <i>kodokushi</i>, or “lonely death,” a social issue in Japan where people pass away alone. 
          Memories of seeing news about it as a child resurfaced as I learned how the issue continues to grow, making me reflect on isolation and fading social connection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Slow pacing, muted colors, and minimal design mirror the stillness and emotional distance of the topic, encouraging viewers to pause and absorb the weight 
          of overlooked quiet moments.
        </p>

        <h2>Project 3: Networked Care</h2>
        <a href="project3/page1.html">Project 3</a>

        <p>
          I created this website to share the story of Korea’s population crisis in a way that feels clear,
          accessible, and visually engaging. Drawing from my p5.js data visualization project, I reworked 
          key elements into simple, interactive graphics.
          <br /><br />
          The site focuses on three interconnected issues: Korea’s declining population, the rapid growth
          of its aging demographic, and the ongoing drop in birth rates. My hope is to raise global awareness,
          especially among non-Korean audiences.

            <p>
              I created a Korean Food Recommender website that suggests personalized Korean dishes based on user preferences like spice level, sweetness, weather, and recent meals. 
              The site features a modern, culturally-inspired design with a clean form interface that leads to a results page showing the top 3 recommended dishes with scores and explanations.

            <p>
              This is an interactive hair collection game where you have to click on scattered hair strands on a tiled floor to clean them up. I made it intentionally frustrating - even when 
              you successfully collect all the hair, the system shows an "ERROR" message and forces you to start over again, inspired by the anti-user-friendly design concept introduced by 
              Yehwan Song. The hair strands are scattered across a simple beige tile floor, and there are always 5-6 pieces to collect each round.

            <h2><a href="https://petal-predict-play.lovable.app/">Loves Me, Loves Me Not</a></h2>
            <p>
              For this vibe-coding assignment, I created an interactive "loves me, loves me not" flower picking game featuring five randomly generated flowers with 7-13 petals each. Users 
              select a flower and watch the petals fall one by one while text alternates between "he loves me" and "he loves me not," culminating in an overwhelming cascade of chaotic flying text. 
              I drew inspiration from mayaontheinter.net's experimental Y2K aesthetics, featuring neon gradients and glitch effects.

            <p>
              For this vibe coding experiment, I took inspiration from Molly Soda’s artist page aesthetic to make a social battery tracker that feels playful and personal. Social interactions 
              show up as receipt-style entries, with glittery borders, pixel textures, and soft pastel tones that echo her diary-like vibe. It turns into a kind of digital collage where each 
              receipt is a small record of vulnerability, connection, and the “cost” of hanging out. In the end, it makes social exhaustion feel more intimate and poetic, but also a little fun.

            <h2><a href="https://memory-fragments-unmade.lovable.app/">Fragments of Memory</a></h2>
            <p>
              My vibe-coding experiment was inspired by Winnie Soon's Unerasable Characters III, exploring how childhood memories fragment, fade, and reconstruct over time. The page asks a series 
              of intimate questions, collecting personal recollections and transforms them into a child-like diary entry where answered questions become narrative fragments and skipped questions 
              manifest as visual glitches and blurred text. By treating memory as data that can be incomplete, corrupted, or lost, the page functions to reveal how absence and erasure are as 
              meaningful as what we remember, creating a poetic visualization of the gaps between experience and recollection.

            <p>
              This vibe coding experiment is an interactive, poetic space inspired by Stephanie Dinkins’ idea of the unencumbered mind in Afro-nowism, reimagined through Korean cultural memory. 
              I use flowing digital silk strands like daenggi ribbons to explore how remembrance and liberation intertwine, with each gesture of untying and retying revealing soft Korean and 
              English whispers. It’s my way of creating a quiet, meditative Korean futurism that blends care, continuity, and digital breath.

            <p>
              I created a vibe coding experiment about recognition and honoring the visible and invisible connections that shape who we are. It asks reflective questions about your life—
              where you're from, who taught you, what brings you comfort—and generates personalized recognitions based on your answers. The piece surfaces relationships you might not have 
              considered: the indigenous peoples whose land you inhabit, the hands that prepared your meals, the workers who assembled your devices. It's rooted in principles from 
              "nonviolent creative code," exploring how we can create work that honors the land, the body, the small, and the people without extracting or exploiting.

            <h2><a href="https://jot-your-thought.lovable.app/?utm_source=lovable-editor">Thought Drop</a></h2>
            <p>
              After reading Brandon Gregory's work on Designing for Cognitive Differences, I vibe-coded a memo website that removes the anxiety of organization and provides constant 
              reassurance through clear feedback. The design focuses on inclusive principles like confirmation messages that tell you exactly what action was taken and when, generous 
              spacing to reduce cognitive load, and calming language that validates the simple act of writing thoughts down. I used a minimal palette (black, white, light beige) and varied 
              typography to create clear visual hierarchy while keeping the interface distraction-free so users can capture random thoughts without any pressure to categorize or perfect it.

            <p>
              I created "Why did you cry?" which is a digital sanctuary inspired by Xin Liu's tear series, where emotions become tangible through water droplets. Each tear recorded 
              transforms into a droplet sized by its intensity, building a personal collection of emotional moments that honors the vulnerability of crying. The interface invites users 
              to witness their accumulated tears as a beautiful, floating constellation of experiences, reframing sadness as something worth preserving and reflecting upon.

              I created an interactive web studio that generates p5.js visual art variations based on user-customized parameters like shapes, colors, and animations, inspired by Olivia Jack's 
              artist website. I wanted to make something practical while also testing AI's ability to generate visual outputs and the underlying code structure. The result is a playground where 
              anyone can experiment with generative design, see the code behind their creations, and explore how simple parameters can produce endlessly looping variations.

          <h2>Vibe Coding Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This semester was my first time working with vibe coding, and it changed the way I think about building digital work. I was genuinely surprised by how quickly simple ideas developed into 
            functioning websites. Seeing something move from a simple idea or thought to a working form in such a short amount of time made the process feel very approachable. At the same time, I became 
            aware of the limitations. Some platforms had difficulty understanding my requests even when I rephrased them, and the results often drifted away from my original intention. In those moments, 
            I was always reminded back to the thought that AI is powerful but not entirely reliable.
          </p>

          <p>
            As I continued the exercises I began to notice a particular feeling in many vibe coded sites. Certain visual and verbal choices made them easy to distinguish from websites created through 
            more traditional methods. The color decisions, the structure, and even the phrasing carried a recognizable tone that felt consistent across different projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, I do see a lot of potential in vibe coding. I believe that it is useful for building a starting point and for testing ideas before committing to a fully developed design. 
            I still believe the creator needs to guide and refine the work afterward in order to give it depth, intention, and a sense of life.
