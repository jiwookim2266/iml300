        This project is driven by my passion for raising awareness about Korea’s
        declining birthrate and aging population, a social issue that deeply
        concerns me. I wanted to experiment with data visualization for Project 1 
        while incorporating audio, making the experience both visual and auditory 
        to engage viewers more fully.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first graph uses bar heights and baby-crying sounds to represent
        birth numbers, the second shows bouncing population circles whose sound 
        volume changes with their size, and the third visualizes the super-aged 
        population with branching veins filling circles. To tie the experience 
        together, I designed a home page where users can select which dataset to 
        explore, and pressing ESC at any time returns them to this starting point.

      <p>
        This project explores the quiet loneliness behind <i>kodokushi</i>, or 
        “lonely death,” a social issue in Japan where people pass away alone and 
        remain unnoticed. When I lived in Japan as a child, I often saw news 
        reports about it without fully understanding. Years later, learning how 
        this issue has continued to grow made me reflect on isolation, aging, and 
        the loss of connection in modern society.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work unfolds through slow pacing, muted colors, and minimal design to 
        echo the stillness and emotional distance surrounding kodokushi. Each page 
        moves gently, mirroring the gradual passing of time and the fading of human 
        contact. By combining simple text, empty space, and soft transitions, I 
        wanted to create an experience that asks viewers to pause and feel the 
        weight of quiet moments that too often go unnoticed.
