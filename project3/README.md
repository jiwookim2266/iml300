I created this website to share the story of Korea’s population crisis in a way that feels clear, accessible, and visually engaging. Drawing from my p5.js data visualization project, I reworked key elements into simple, interactive graphics that make the information easier to understand. The site focuses on three interconnected issues: Korea’s declining population, the rapid growth of its aging demographic, and the ongoing drop in birth rates. My hope is to raise global awareness, especially among non-Korean audiences, since this challenge is often overlooked outside of Korea and Asia despite its broader social relevance.
