    <p class="page4-desc">
      Korea’s low birth rate has become a critical demographic concern, with the
      number of births dropping sharply over recent decades. This decline reflects
      broader social pressures such as economic burdens, long working hours, rising
      childcare costs, and shifting cultural expectations that make starting families
      increasingly difficult. As the birth rate continues to fall, the long-term
      implications raise uncertainty about the country’s future sustainability.
      <br><br>
      This visualization translates the decline into shrinking stacks of circles,
      where each stack represents a year and the number of circles corresponds to the
      number of births. As time moves forward, the stacks gradually thin out, visually
      echoing Korea’s demographic contraction. When hovered, the circles turn red and
      the audio intensifies in proportion to the data.
