    <p class="page5-desc">
      Korea is entering a period of population decline as both low birth numbers and a rising elderly population reshape the country’s demographic structure. The total population has begun to shrink, and this downward trend reflects broader uncertainties about how the country will sustain growth, support its aging citizens, and preserve social stability in the years ahead.

      This visualization shows the shrinking population through moving circles whose sizes correspond to the total population of each projected year. As the values decrease over time, the circles become visibly smaller, drifting within the boundary to create a sense of gradual contraction. Their color shifts and the sound volume responds to their size, emphasizing the continuous decline expressed in the data.
