    <p class="about-desc">
      I created this website to share the story of Korea’s population crisis in a way that feels clear,
      accessible, and visually engaging. Drawing from my p5.js data visualization project, I reworked 
      key elements into simple, interactive graphics that make the information easier to understand.
      <br><br>
      The site focuses on three interconnected issues: Korea’s declining population, the rapid growth
      of its aging demographic, and the ongoing drop in birth rates. My hope is to raise global awareness,
      especially among non-Korean audiences, since this challenge is often overlooked outside of Korea
      and Asia despite its broader social relevance.
