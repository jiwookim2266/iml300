    <h1>There Is No Tomorrow</h1>
    <p class="explain">
      In Japan, thousands of elderly people pass away alone every year.  
      Their absence often goes unnoticed until the smell, the rent, or the silence alerts someone.  
      This phenomenon is called <em>kodokushi</em>, meaning lonely death.<br><br>

      Behind every case is a person who once had a routine, friends, a family, a story.  
      Over time, the world around them becomes smaller.  
      One unreturned call, one unopened envelope, one quiet meal at a time.<br><br>

      Kodokushi is not only about dying alone.  
      It is about the slow fading of connection, the moment when life continues  
      but no one bears witness to it.  
      It reflects a deeper loneliness that exists in modern life,  
      where independence quietly replaces closeness,  
      and aging becomes something to manage instead of something to share.<br><br>

      To speak about kodokushi is to ask what it means to care for one another,  
      not only during moments of crisis but through the ordinary days in between.  
      It matters because behind the statistics are people who still wished  
      to be seen, heard, and remembered, even once more.
